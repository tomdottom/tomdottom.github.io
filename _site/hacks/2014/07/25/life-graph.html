<p>Many of us will experience important events, have moments of epiphany, get given advice to follow. These and numerous other moments of chance can in a short instance alter the way we live our lives.</p>

<p>Less spetacular are those influences that have equally life changing effects yet take time to act and take effect. Personal coaching, reading self help books, sport,</p>

<h2>A Life Graph</h2>

<p>Along these latter lines I recently noticed a small project of my brothers hanging on his bedroom wall. This small colourful chart shows each year on a row with months lived coloured in green and  space for months yet to come. Extending out to his 80th year it gives a quick persepective of the time he has left.</p>

<p>At first it seems morbid, but when viewed as a motivator it can be seen as an excuse to do stuff every day, a reason not to say no to anything. It is effect a slow ticking clock that can convey two almost contradictory messages at the same time:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>You have enough time to do, see, experience and feel so many things.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and yet</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>You don&#39;t have that much time so get a move on</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I few quick lines of code and I can quickly see that I&#39;ve <a href="https://tomdottom.github.io/life-graph/#birthdate/06/11/1980">used up a healthy amount</a> of my disposable time. More promising, however, is all that white space that I&#39;ve got left to fill.</p>

<p>Just follow the linkk if you&#39;d like to <a href="https://tomdottom.github.io/life-graph/">generate you own life graph</a>.</p>

<h2>Ideas left untouched</h2>

<p>It was a quick code up of a small idea stuck to a wall, but the bigger idea included other motivational triggers such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>logging one thing that I did each day (along with reminders)</li>
<li>suggestions of things to do (possible tie ins with other services)</li>
<li>retrospectives to show what you&#39;ve done in the past week, month, year, decade</li>
</ul>

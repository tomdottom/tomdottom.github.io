This past Sunday I had the opportunity to hang around with
[@stef][@stef] from [Makeshift][Makeshift]
learning about the philosophy that has generated a great many
of his ideas, hacks, websites and a few sucessful companies for good measure.

It was a great weekend full of interesting people and I walked away with a
greated appreciation of hacking up ideas quickly a few of which can be found
below.

## Take your big idea and choose the smallest part

We all have grand ideas, multipage apps with plenty of features, dreams of
international companies that affect the lives of many. The downside is that
building anything on scale is hard and daunting and as [@Stef][@Stef] pointed
out you may get bored of your idea pretty quickly. 

Lacking in time, money and resources as we are, the best advice here was to
choose the smallest part of your big idea that will let you showcase, prove or
test part of your big idea. It should be something you can build in a weekend
and get out in front of people quickly and demonstrate that one small part of
your big idea easily.

## Talk about your idea and it will change for the better...

It's happened to all of us. You've had an idea, sketched parts of it and it all
seems to fit together to neatly and clearly in your head. But the moment you
start explaining it to a friend or colleauge we find our assumptions challanged,
alternative views presented and similar products or projects that we never knew
about brought to light.

### ...but only with the right person

It's important here to make sure that the person your talking to is
constructive. Find someone that will open up your idea, help you break it up
into small peices and create many more small parts.

With any luck you'll have more than a few good parts of you big idea that you
can turn into a small hack and get to work with.

## The smallest hack from seasoned professional...

As alluded to before these small projects don't have to be anything complex.
Buy a domain, spend half an hour createing some content with
[Strikingly](https://www.strikingly.com "Stirkingly - The website builder"),
publish it, push it out via your social media channels or paid ads and
gauge the response.

[@Stef][@Stef] did this in front of us and in around half and hour created a
tounge in cheek site to sell his daily recommondation to [Product
Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com) on his aptly named site [Product
Punt](http://www.productpunt.com). A great end to the hack was that it climbed
to the top spot in Product Hunt as people joined in on the joke and upvoted
and commented on the site.

## ... and not so seasoned professionals

Others from attending the weekend followed [@Stef's][@Stef] example.

[Tim][@tdobson] created a site to product test the most
desirable features of [Learn to Car][L2Car] a prospective app for those
learning to drive.

[Marc][@marcwgdavies] created a mock up of a project called
Charity Jar (later just shortened to Jar) which aimed to create a network
wherein charitable investments could be made in social enterprises and provide
feedback on long term performance thus allowing the investors to see the growth
of the enterprises (as measured by the current value of their investments) and
their lifetime charitable impact.

## Remember a hack is a hack is a hack

It pays to keep in mind that a hack is just meant to demonstrate your idea.
It's aceptable for it to have bugs in the code and be a little rough around the
edges. Always keep in mind that it isn't meant to be a finished product.

On a personal note this is one of the hardest things for me to accept and yet
at the same time one of the most liberating. No need to test, no guilty
feelings when you write quick and dirty code, use any library that makes things
faster to develop forget about performance.

Should you ever be fortunate enough to turn one of your hacks into a product
remember to throw away the code and start again. It'll probably take a lot less
time than you suspect.

## Constrain your time - you need a deadline

If you don't give yourslef a deadline your idea faces that danger that it'll
never see the light of day. By promising yourself to publish by a set time then
you guarantee to get it out into the wider world and get feedback.

Better still there's a greater sense of achievment in finishing many small
projects rather than having many large ones gathering metaphorical dust on your
harddrive.

The other day I was asked to talk through an idea and banned from saying
*'but'* as it would bring a premature end to any line of thought, or result in
a debate of a single point instead of growing and exploring the initial idea.

# Yes and!

Instead we were asked to keep in mind a rule of improve and say "Yes' and!"
which in improv allow all actors to accept the reality of the scene they're
playing out.

When growing and exploring an idea it is just as help
conversation and are continuosuly trying to open it up.

# Don't block the conversation

# Always add to the idea

Instead I was asked to say 'Yes and' and build upon the idea presented to me
adding suggestions, solving problems instead of problems and presented
unidentified avenues as idea generating opportunities.

[ Look up other ideas for making the conversation flow ]

Many of us will experience important events, have moments of epiphany, get given advice to follow. These and numerous other moments of chance can in a short instance alter the way we live our lives.

Less spetacular are those influences that have equally life changing effects yet take time to act and take effect. Personal coaching, reading self help books, sport,


## A Life Graph

Along these latter lines I recently noticed a small project of my brothers hanging on his bedroom wall. This small colourful chart shows each year on a row with months lived coloured in green and  space for months yet to come. Extending out to his 80th year it gives a quick persepective of the time he has left.

At first it seems morbid, but when viewed as a motivator it can be seen as an excuse to do stuff every day, a reason not to say no to anything. It is effect a slow ticking clock that can convey two almost contradictory messages at the same time:

> ***You have enough time to do, see, experience and feel so many things.***

and yet

> ***You don't have that much time so get a move on***

I few quick lines of code and I can quickly see that I've [used up a healthy amount](https://tomdottom.github.io/life-graph/#birthdate/06/11/1980) of my disposable time. More promising, however, is all that white space that I've got left to fill.

## Ideas left untouched

It was a quick code up of a small idea stuck to a wall, but the bigger idea included other motivational triggers such as:

* logging one thing that I did each day (along with reminders)
* suggestions of things to do (possible tie ins with other services)
* retrospectives to show what you've done in the past week, month, year, decade

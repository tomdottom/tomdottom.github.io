A whirlwind tour starting starting with a easy introduction to logic machines and how they can be combined to create computer memory. Then onto a higher abstraction by introducing and then applying types to our logic machines.

For me this was a quick, and high level, refresher of much of my A-Level & Electronic Engineering Degree.  It then delved into CS subjects that I've had to pick-up/stumble-upon myself and a few which are new to me.

> As a little inspiration, if you, gentle reader, have managed to get this far in the book, and still consider yourself to be a “non-technical” type, take heart! Reasoning by way of the type system is indeed a powerful art, and one that most professional computer scientists have yet to come across, let alone master. Unfortunately for them, this is a skill that would make their day-to-day jobs tremendously easier, if only they knew it. I tell you this not to belittle them, but to inspire you.

Both a fantastic books and an infuriatingly awful book at the same time. The
story, a quick tour through the foundations of modern mathematics, is well
planned and extremely interesting. This, however, is spoiled by the authors
excessively flowery and overly elaborate prose. And possible the worst past
and an infuriating overuse of ellipsis ...
